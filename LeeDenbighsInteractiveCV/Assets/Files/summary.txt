With over 15 years as a dedicated hobbyist developer, my journey in software engineering has been fuelled by a deep-rooted passion for technology and innovation. My adventure began with Visual Basic, laying the groundwork for a profound understanding of programming fundamentals. This early exposure sparked a transition to C#, where I honed my skills by creating diverse applications, exploring the intricacies of software development, and embracing the challenges it presents.

Though my academic path in software engineering was rerouted due to personal circumstances, my commitment to learning and growth in the field never wavered. As a father, I'm not just coding for a career but also to inspire, demonstrating the value of perseverance and dedication to my son and my soon-to-arrive baby. Balancing parenthood with personal development, I've continuously advanced my expertise in C# and software design through self-study and practical application.
My objective is clear: to transition from a hobbyist to a professional developer, where I can contribute meaningfully to a team, create impactful software solutions, and turn my long-standing dream into my everyday reality. I bring with me not just technical proficiency, but a resilient, hardworking ethos and a love for tackling complex challenges. I am eager to embark on this professional journey, leveraging my skills to innovate, solve problems, and make a tangible difference through software development.
