In my academic journey, I delved into the world of art and art textiles during my GCSEs, which honed my creative skills. Parallel to this, I harboured a growing fascination for IT and computers. This interest was further ignited in 2004 when I inherited my grandfather's PC. It was this pivotal moment that sparked my self-driven journey into the realm of software development. Starting with Visual Basic, I taught myself the fundamentals of coding, which laid the groundwork for my transition to C#. This unique blend of artistic flair and technical proficiency forms the cornerstone of my educational background.
