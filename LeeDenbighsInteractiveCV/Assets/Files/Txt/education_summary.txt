I have been to Uni twice in the past, both for similar subjects (Software Engineering). I just believe I went at the wrong time, I don’t think I was in the right frame of mind. I was young and didn’t appreciate it. I left both times, because I believed I could teach myself better and at a much quicker speed. Most of what I was learning, I had already taught myself.
I did pick up some valuable knowledge with my time there, though.
